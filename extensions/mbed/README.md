### iotz - mbed

Try now! (lets create an mbed `hello-world` project)

```
iotz create mbed DISCO_L475VG_IOT01A hello
cd hello
iotz init
```

Everything is set! Go and edit `hello.cpp` now.
Once you are finished;

```
iotz compile
```

That's it! The binary you need is under `BUILD/` folder.
Flash that binary into your board and you are all set.

Documentation for all the iotz commands is available under [README](../../README.md)
